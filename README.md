# CS202: Software Tools & Techniques for CSE 🚀  

Welcome to my CS202 repository! This is where I'll be tracking my progress, code, analysis, reports, and results from lab assignments conducted in this course.  

## 📌 Course Overview  
CS202 is all about software tools and techniques used in software engineering and research. The focus is on version control, repository mining, code analysis, debugging, testing, and automation. Expect a lot of hands-on learning with real-world tools!  

**Instructor:** Prof. Shouvick Mondal (IIT Gandhinagar)

## 🛠️ Topics Covered  
- **Version Control & CI/CD** – Git workflows, GitHub Actions, Agile DevOps  
- **Software Repository Mining** – Bug fix tracking, commit analysis, LLM-based bug inference  
- **Diff Algorithms & Code Complexity** – Git diff, Myers, Histogram, McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity  
- **Code Coverage & Test Generation** – Static/Dynamic analysis, pytest, pynguin, coverage.py  
- **Profiling & Debugging** – GDB, Linux perf, Visual Studio debugger  
- **Build Automation** – Makefiles, Gradle, Apache Maven  

## 🔧 Tools Used  
Git, Pydriller, Lizard, CodeBERTScore, pytest, coverage.py, Pynguin, CircleCI, and many more!  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- `Lab n/` – Code & analysis from lab assignments like outputs, screenshots, insights, additional resources, references, etc
- `Lab Reports/` – Structured reports for assessments  

This repo is a work in progress as I go through the course. Let’s see how it unfolds! 😃
